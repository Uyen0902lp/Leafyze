## How to Use
### Prerequisites
1. Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and create an account (if you don’t have one).
2. Dataset:
   - Visit the [Tomato Leaves Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishmotwani/tomato).

### Running the Notebooks
1. **Upload the Notebooks**:
   - Download the required notebook (e.g., `DenseNet121.ipynb`) from this directory.
   - Upload it to Kaggle’s notebook environment.

2. **Set up the Dataset**:
   - Make sure the dataset is uploaded or linked to your Kaggle notebook environment.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute the cells sequentially or use the `Run All` option to execute all cells in the notebook.

## Notes
- These notebooks are optimized to run in Kaggle's free GPU environment for better performance.
- Modify hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, or epochs directly in the notebooks for experimentation.
