These spots gradually develop into concentric black rings, resembling a target, with the surrounding leaf tissue turning yellow.\r\n\r\nüçÇ Leaf Yellowing and Shedding: When numerous spots are present on a leaf, the entire leaf turns yellow and may fall off. Under favorable conditions for the disease, the plant may experience complete defoliation.\r\n\r\nüå± Stem and Petiole Lesions: Dark brown, elongated, sunken lesions appear on the stem and petioles. If the lesions develop near the soil surface, they may form a \"girdle\" around the stem, hindering the plant\'s growth.', 'üî¨ Bacterial Survival: The bacteria Alternaria tomatophila and A. solani can survive from one season to the next in plant debris left in the soil.\r\n\r\nüå± Other Sources of Infection: Wild tomatoes, potatoes, and other plants of the nightshade family can also serve as sources of infection.\r\n\r\nüå¶Ô∏è Disease Development Conditions: The disease thrives in warm (24-29¬∞C) and humid weather. It primarily spreads through wind and rain, as fungal spores are easily dispersed in the air. Prolonged warm and moist conditions promote vigorous disease development. It can also flare up in dry, hot climates, especially when plants suffer from frequent water stress or when overhead irrigation is used.', 'üí¶ Preventive Spraying: Combining preventive spraying with an early warning system is the most effective way to control and prevent disease spread.\r\n\r\nüßπ Field Sanitation: Implementing sanitation measures such as crop rotation, tillage, and removal of all crop residues from the previous season helps reduce the risk of disease development.', 0),
(2, 'Late Blight', 'üëæ Phytophthora infestans: A fungus that causes late blight in tomatoes, thriving in wet conditions, leading to leaf rot and reduced yield.', 'üçÉ Initial Symptoms: Infected leaves show drooping petioles.\r\n\r\nüå± Lesions on Leaves and Stems: Large, irregular, water-soaked lesions appear on leaves and stems, initially pale green. These lesions gradually expand, turn brown, and develop a parchment-like appearance.\r\n\r\nüíß In Humid Conditions: Under humid weather, the fungus proliferates rapidly, producing spores on the underside of leaves.\r\n\r\n‚òÅÔ∏è Rapid Spread in Moist Conditions: Leaves can develop widespread blight rapidly in warm, moist conditions.\r\n\r\nüåæ Crop Damage: If the disease progresses severely, the entire field can suffer heavy damage, with significant leaf and stem injury.', 'üçÑ Fungal Survival: The late blight fungus can survive from season to season on wild-growing tomatoes and potatoes, in compost piles, or on other nightshade plants.\r\n\r\nüå¨Ô∏è Sources of Spread: The fungus produces spores that can be carried long distances by strong winds or storms, facilitating rapid disease spread in the environment.\r\n\r\nüåßÔ∏è Favorable Weather Conditions: The disease thrives in cool, wet weather, promoting rapid spread and damage. Under these conditions, the fungus can devastate an entire tomato field in just a few days.\r\n\r\nüè° Enclosed Environments: Crops grown in greenhouses or tunnels are also susceptible to late blight if humidity is not properly controlled.\r\n\r\nüí¶ High Humidity: The disease progresses rapidly in high humidity. The late blight fungus requires high moisture levels to infect and can spread quickly in wet environments.', 'üíß Preventive Spraying: Combining preventive spraying with a late blight forecasting system is the most effective way to control and prevent the disease.\r\n\r\nüåæ Field Management: Avoid planting tomatoes in fields or near areas previously planted with potatoes, as the late blight fungus also affects potatoes. In greenhouses or covered growing areas, maintaining low humidity helps reduce the risk of infection.', 0),

These spots may be angular, turning gray with a somewhat translucent center and a black border. The center of the spot is often dry, cracked, and surrounded by a yellow halo. Under high humidity conditions (heavy rain, fog, or dew), the leaves may turn yellow and fall off.\r\n\r\nüå± Development Location: The disease can occur on all above-ground parts of the plant. Lesions are usually more prevalent on young leaves where the canopy is developing.', 'ü¶† Bacterial Survival: The bacteria can survive long-term in plant debris, wild hosts, and seeds, increasing the risk of infecting new crops.\r\n\r\nüí¶ Irrigation Method: Overhead irrigation (directly spraying water from above) can facilitate the rapid spread of bacteria, particularly during plant care.\r\n\r\nüåæ Infection Pathways: In the field, the disease often enters through wounds on plants, such as those caused by insect feeding, strong winds, heavy rain, or high-pressure irrigation.\r\n\r\nüå°Ô∏è Temperature and Humidity Conditions: Warm temperatures (24-30¬∞C) combined with heavy rain or overhead irrigation create ideal conditions for vigorous bacterial growth.', 'üå± Select Disease-Free Seeds: Sow seeds that have been tested and certified free of pathogenic bacteria. Ensure seedlings are free of disease before transplanting.\r\n\r\nüß¥ Use Plant Protection Chemicals: Apply copper-based sprays to protect plants, although their effectiveness may diminish over time as bacteria develop resistance.\r\n\r\nüö´ Avoid Overhead Irrigation: Avoid overhead watering to prevent the spread of bacteria through water.\r\n\r\nüîÑ Crop Rotation: Rotate with non-solanaceous crops or non-host plants to reduce the risk of bacteria persisting in the soil.\r\n\r\nüßπ Field Sanitation: Clean up and till all plant debris immediately after harvest to reduce the risk of outbreaks in future crops.\r\n\r\nüçÖ Choose Disease-Resistant Varieties: Where possible, select tomato varieties resistant to the specific bacterial strains prevalent in the area to improve disease prevention.', 0),

If they do, the fruits do not fully develop, resulting in significantly reduced yield.', 'ü™¥ Susceptible Plants: The virus causing yellow leaf curl affects not only tomatoes but can also spread to other crops such as beans, corn, and various other plants.\r\n\r\n‚è±Ô∏è Rapid Transmission: Whiteflies only need to feed on an infected plant for about 15-30 minutes to transmit the virus to healthy plants.\r\n\r\nüåû Favorable Conditions: The disease easily spreads in warm, humid weather, which promotes whitefly population growth and virus transmission.', 'ü™ü Whitefly Control: Chemical insecticides are often ineffective against whiteflies, so using insect-proof netting is recommended to prevent whitefly contact with plants.\r\n\r\nüßπ Field Sanitation: Remove infected plant debris and weeds, and implement regular sanitation measures to reduce the risk of new disease spread.\r\n\r\nüîÑ Crop Rotation: Intercrop with non-solanaceous plants to limit the spread of the virus in tomato growing areas.', 0),
(6, 'Target Spot', 'üåë Corynespora cassiicola: A fungus that causes target spot on leaves, producing round brown spots and leading to early leaf drop, which impacts crop yield.', 'üçÉ On Leaves: The disease begins with tiny spots on the leaves that quickly develop into larger, light brown spots, often surrounded by a pale yellow halo. These spots can sometimes expand, causing the infected leaf tissue to die.\r\n\r\nüåø On Stems: Initial symptoms are small lesions that quickly expand and elongate, potentially girdling the stem, causing the leaves above the lesion to wilt. In severe cases, multiple lesions form on stems and leaves, leading to wilting and ultimately plant death.', 'üå°Ô∏è Optimal Temperature Range: The fungus causing leaf spot can survive in a wide temperature range. The disease spreads readily when temperatures range from 16-32¬∞C, especially under prolonged high humidity (>16 hours).\r\n\r\nüí® Modes of Spread: Fungal spores develop extensively on infected tissues and can easily spread through the air or irrigation activities.', 'üíß Preventive Spraying: Begin applying fungicides as soon as symptoms are detected to minimize damage caused by leaf spot disease.', 0),
(7, 'Tomato Mosaic Virus', 'ü¶† Tobamovirus: A group of viruses that cause mosaic disease, resulting in mottled and discolored leaves, leading to stunted growth and reduced yield.', 'üçÉ On Leaves: Leaves develop mottled discoloration, with yellow spots, deformation, and curling. Leaf size becomes uneven, and they may wilt or become necrotic.\r\n\r\nüå± Plant Growth: The plant shows stunted growth, reduced vigor, curled leaves, and brittleness. In cool weather, young leaves may twist. Under hot and humid conditions, leaf symptoms may be less noticeable, but the yield is significantly reduced.', 'üîç Sources of Infection: The virus can spread from contaminated farming tools, weeds, and infected plants. Seeds from infected plants are also a source of transmission.\r\n\r\nüõ†Ô∏è Transmission Methods: The virus can persist in the environment, on tools, and insects. It can spread through the hands of caretakers, clothing, or farming tools if not properly sanitized.', 'üß¨ Use Disease-Resistant Varieties: Choosing resistant varieties is the most effective prevention method, although some new Tobamovirus strains may overcome resistance.\r\n\r\nü™£ Field Sanitation: Implement sanitation measures such as washing hands and tools with alcohol-based disinfectants (e.g., 1% alcohol) to eliminate the virus.\r\n\r\nüß∞ Tool Sanitation: Gardening tools should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Plastic containers and planting trays can be effectively cleaned and disinfected with bleach. Avoid reusing soil that has been contaminated.', 0),
(8, 'Leaf Mold', 'üçÇ Passalora fulva (also known as Fulvia fulva or Cladosporium fulvum): A fungus that causes leaf mold in tomatoes, producing yellow spots and an olive-green mold on the underside of leaves, leading to leaf wilting.\r\n', 'üçÉ On Leaves: The disease typically affects the leaves, and occasionally the stems, flowers, and fruits. Early symptoms include pale green to yellow patches on the upper surface of older leaves, with olive-green fungal spores developing on the underside.\r\n\r\nüçÇ Leaf Drop: As the disease progresses, lower leaves begin to yellow and fall off. Affected fruits may develop a black, tough, leathery layer on the blossom end.\r\n\r\nüè† Occurrence Environment: The disease can occur in open fields but is more prevalent in greenhouses, where it spreads rapidly under favorable conditions.', 'üå± Fungal Survival: The fungus can persist as spores and sclerotia in soil and plant debris for at least one year.\r\n\r\nüå°Ô∏è Conditions for Spread: The fungus can spread through clothing, gardening tools, and easily disseminates when relative humidity reaches 90% and the optimal temperature is 24¬∞C. The disease can also develop at temperatures between 10 and 32¬∞C, but will not progress if humidity drops below 85%.', 'üí® Preventive Spraying: In greenhouses, ensure proper ventilation and heating to keep humidity below 85%. Plant disease-resistant varieties if available, although it is challenging to select a variety resistant to all Passalora fulva strains in a given area.', 0),
(9, 'Two-Spotted Spider Mites', 'üï∑Ô∏è Tetranychus urticae: The two-spotted spider mite, a pest that affects many crops, causing leaf discoloration, small yellow spots, and potentially leading to leaf desiccation.', 'üçÉ On Leaves: Small, pale yellow or white spots appear on the underside of leaves where the spider mites feed. As the mite population increases, the leaves gradually turn yellow or brown, become dry, and may fall prematurely. Additionally, a thin webbing may appear on the underside of leaves, providing protection for the mites and making them easier to spot.\r\n\r\nüå± On Plants: Spider mites cause stunted growth and slow development as the plant loses vital fluids and nutrients. In severe infestations, the plant weakens significantly, reducing both yield and fruit quality.', 'üå°Ô∏è Temperature and Humidity: Spider mites thrive in high temperatures (25-30¬∞C) and low humidity. Hot, dry weather accelerates their reproduction, with rapid growth cycles allowing each generation to complete in approximately 5-10 days.\r\n\r\nüçÉ Spread: Spider mites easily spread through wind, caretakers, and gardening tools. They can also move from plant to plant, especially when the population density on a single plant becomes too high.', 'üêû Biological Control: Using natural predators of spider mites, such as predatory mites like Phytoseiulus persimilis or Amblyseius californicus, can help control spider mite populations naturally.\r\n\r\nüíß Watering: Increasing humidity around plants by misting them or maintaining moisture in their surroundings can reduce spider mite growth, as they do not thrive in humid environments.\r\n\r\nüß¥ Horticultural Oil or Soap Sprays: Using horticultural oils or insecticidal soaps can effectively eliminate spider mites by damaging their protective wax layer, causing them to dry out and die.\r\n\r\nüï∏Ô∏è Miticide Sprays: In cases of high mite populations where biological control is ineffective, specialized miticides can be used. However, rotating different miticides is necessary to prevent the development of resistance.', 0),
(10, 'Powdery Mildew', 'üåø Leveillula taurica (asexual stage: Oidium sicula): A fungus that causes powdery mildew on various plants, forming a white powdery layer on the underside of leaves, leading to yellowing and wilting.\r\n\r\nüçÖ Oidium neolycopersici: Causes powdery mildew on tomatoes, appearing as small white spots on the upper side of leaves, resulting in drying and premature leaf drop.\r\n\r\n‚òÅÔ∏è Oidium lycopersici: Also causes powdery mildew on tomatoes, covering leaves with a white powdery coating, which affects photosynthesis and overall plant health.', 'üå± Leveillula taurica: Initial symptoms include pale green to bright yellow spots appearing on the leaf surface. Subsequently, a white fungal powder begins to develop on the leaf surface. Under ideal conditions, white spore masses can form on both sides of the leaf. As the disease progresses, leaves turn brown, wilt, and may die. Infected plants often produce small fruits and are more susceptible to sunburn.\r\n\r\nüçÇ Oidium neolycopersici and O. lycopersici: The disease appears as round, white spots on the upper surface of leaves. These powdery spots gradually enlarge, causing the underlying leaf tissue to turn brown and dry out. Oidium typically develops on the upper leaf surface, while Leveillula appears on the underside of leaves. In severe infections, fungal spores may cover the entire surface of leaves, petioles, and flower calyxes, but the fruit is generally not affected.', 'üçÉ Leveillula taurica: This fungus can persist on many host plants and may spread to tomatoes. Its spores are easily dispersed by wind and can germinate under relatively low humidity conditions (52-75%). The fungus thrives at high temperatures above 27¬∞C and can grow within a range of 10 to 32¬∞C.\r\n\r\nüåßÔ∏è Oidium neolycopersici and O. lycopersici: These fungi grow best under low light conditions, temperatures ranging from 20-27¬∞C, and high humidity (85-95%). However, with Leveillula taurica, the disease can still develop under low humidity conditions (around 50%).', 'üíß Preventive Spraying: Use fungicides, particularly those containing sulfur. Ensure thorough coverage and apply at the right time for maximum effectiveness.\r\n\r\nüßÇ Other Measures: Bicarbonate (baking soda) or hydroxide (slaked lime) can also be used to control powdery mildew.', 0),
